I'm a retired substation operator for the local utility in Detroit, Michigan. Hints the name operator007.
I'm also a full time caregiver for my wife of 17 years who suffers from chronic multiple sclerosis.
I think there is a great need for caregivers to access resources essential to everyday life.
I wish to dedicate my time and effort to learn all the skills necessary to contribute to this cause.
